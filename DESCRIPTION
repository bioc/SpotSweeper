Description: Spatially-aware quality control (QC) software for both spot-level 
    and artifact-level QC in spot-based spatial transcripomics, such as 10x 
    Visium. These methods calculate local (nearest-neighbors) mean and variance 
    of standard QC metrics (library size, unique genes, and mitochondrial 
    percentage) to identify outliers spot and large technical artifacts.

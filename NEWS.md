# SpotSweeper Package News

## Version 1.3.1

### Major Changes
- **Function Renaming**: The function `plotQC` has been renamed to `plotQCmetrics` to better reflect its purpose. The new function `plotQCmetrics` should be used moving forward. This change improves clarity in the packageâ€™s API by specifying that this function is designed for plotting QC metrics.

### Deprecations
- **`plotQC` Function Deprecated**: The `plotQC` function is now deprecated. While it remains available for backward compatibility, users are encouraged to transition to `plotQCmetrics`. Calling `plotQC` will display a warning, reminding users of the deprecation.

This change is backward compatible; existing code using `plotQC` will still work but will show a warning. We recommend updating your code to use `plotQCmetrics` to avoid any issues in future versions where `plotQC` may be removed.
